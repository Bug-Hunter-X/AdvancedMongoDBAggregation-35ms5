# Incorrect MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline that attempts to group documents and count occurrences. However, due to an issue in the pipeline's structure, the grouping and counting are not performed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline has an error in the `$group` stage.  The `_id` field in the `$group` stage is used to specify how to group documents, but if it's not correctly defined, unexpected results occur.  The provided example illustrates this type of error.  The solution addresses this by improving the `_id` field and pipeline structure.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves carefully examining the `$group` stage, ensuring that the `_id` field correctly specifies the grouping criteria.  The solution may also require adjustments to other stages in the pipeline to ensure data consistency and accuracy. The corrected pipeline is provided to rectify the error and generate the correct results.
